# Billing PreProcessor

_The service provides functionality for storing invoicing records and associated accounting information, as well as their respective status (created, attested, invoiced or rejected). The records that have status attested will be included in a generated file that is sent to the Raindance system for invoicing and accounting. The sent invoices will then be changed to status invoiced._

_The service contains two periodic jobs that are executed at certain intervals, one to create the invoice files to be sent and one to send files to the Raindance system. These jobs are executed once per day._

## Usage

### API Endpoints

See the [API Documentation](#api-documentation) for detailed information on available endpoints.

### Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/2281/billingrecords?filter=category : 'SOME-CATEGORY' and status : 'APPROVED'
```

## Configuration

Configuration is crucial for the application to run successfully. Ensure all necessary settings are configured in `application.yml`.

### Key Configuration Parameters

- **Server Port:**

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080
```

- **Database Settings**

```yaml
spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://<server>:<port>/<database-name>
    username: <username>
    password: <password>
```

- **External Service URLs**

```yaml
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        registration:
          messaging:
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
          party:
            client-id: <client-id>
            client-secret: <client-secret>
        provider:
          messaging:
            token-uri: <token-url>
          party:
            token-uri: <token-url>

integration:
  messaging:
    url: <service_url>
  party:
    url: <service_url>
  sftp:
    municipalityIds:
      <municipality-id>:
        host: <host-name>
        user: <user>
        port: <port>
        remoteDir: <remote-dir>
```

- **Recipients of reports**

```yaml
errorreport:
  recipients:
    - <email-to-recipient>
```

### Database Initialization

The project is set up with [Flyway](https://github.com/flyway/flyway) for database migrations. Flyway is disabled by default so you will have to enable it to automatically populate the database schema upon application startup.

```yaml
spring:
  flyway:
    enabled: true
```

- **No additional setup is required** for database initialization, as long as the database connection settings are correctly configured.

### Additional Notes

- **Application Profiles:**

  Use Spring profiles (`dev`, `prod`, etc.) to manage different configurations for different environments.

- **Logging Configuration:**

  Adjust logging levels if necessary.
